  📦 Project Overview

Realtime Chat App is a full-stack chat application designed to enable seamless real-time communication between users. The application is built using Vite + React on the frontend, Spring Boot on the backend, and MongoDB as the primary NoSQL database. It uses Tailwind CSS for responsive UI styling and WebSockets for real-time messaging.

The application provides features such as real-time messaging, user authentication, online status indicators, and persistent message storage. The backend APIs are built in Java using Spring Boot, with MongoDB providing scalable and fast data operations.

Realtime Chat App is a portfolio project demonstrating modern full-stack web development using a reactive UI and robust backend architecture.
